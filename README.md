# Scorpion Design System

A lean eight-page portfolio site for the Scorpion Design System: a TUI-inspired, token-based system built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The site runs on a vendored snapshot of the design system and links out to the deployed Storybook for all reference documentation.

## 🎨 What is This?

This is the design system's **portfolio front door**, not its documentation site. Eight pages in three groups:

**Front door**

- `/` - **Home**: hero, three card rows (what's inside, the writing, the system itself)

**The writing**

- `/essay` - **Essay**: "Design Systems for AI-First Product Development"
- `/case-study` - **Case Study**: "Building the Scorpion Design System"

**The demos**

- `/demos/music-player` - **Music Player**: the floating now-playing pattern with a real audio engine
- `/demos/screens` - **Screens**: a working mini-app (sign-in, settings, profile) composed from DS components

**The system itself**

- `/skills` - **Skills**: the named agent workflows that build and maintain scorp-ds
- `/specs` - **Specs**: every component spec, indexed from `docs/specs/*.md` in scorp-ds
- `/harness` - **Harness**: the lint rules, CI workflows, contracts, visual baselines and decision records that make each written rule fail out loud

Reference documentation (tokens, components, patterns, theming) lives in the deployed Storybook:

**https://sachahurley.github.io/scorp-ds/**

All old documentation routes (`/foundation/*`, `/components/*`, `/tokens/*`, `/patterns/*`) redirect to the pages above. The full documentation site is archived at the `v1-full-docs-site` tag.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:5173`

4. **Toggle between light and dark themes** using the theme toggle in the header (dark is the default)!

## 🛠 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Type-check and build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run deploy` - Publish `dist/` to GitHub Pages (gh-pages branch, base `/scorpion-design-system/`)
- `npm run ds:check` - Diff the vendored DS snapshot against scorp-ds (includes both generated indexes)
- `npm run vendor:ds` - Re-sync the vendored DS snapshot and regenerate both indexes

### Deployment

The site is a Vite + React Router SPA deployed to GitHub Pages under the base path `/scorpion-design-system/`. CI (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) builds and deploys `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch on every push to main, so merging is deploying. `npm run build` itself creates the `404.html` SPA fallback (a copy of `index.html`), which GitHub Pages needs to serve deep links; every deploy path ships it automatically. For a manual deploy, use `npm run deploy` (`scripts/deploy.sh`), which builds, verifies the fallback, and publishes.

**Scorpion Design System** - A design system for your next project 🦂

## Vendored design system

This site wears the merged Scorp DS identity as a deliberate snapshot: token
variables and the Tailwind preset live in `vendor/scorp-ds/`, and the files in
`src/components/ui/` are copies of the scorp-ds component sources (with three
mechanical Vite adaptations). It is NOT auto-synced when scorp-ds merges.

- `npm run ds:check`: diff the snapshot against scorp-ds `origin/main`
- `npm run vendor:ds`: re-sync from `origin/main`, then `npm run build`,
  review the diff, and commit

### Generated page data

Two files under `src/data/` are **generated, never hand-edited**. Both are
written by `vendor:ds` and diffed by `ds:check`, so a page cannot quietly quote
a number the design system no longer has:

- `specs-index.json` - built by `scripts/gen-specs-index.mjs` from
  `docs/specs/*.md`. Drives the Specs page.
- `harness-index.json` - built by `scripts/gen-harness-index.mjs` from the
  `scorp/*` lint rules, the CI workflows, the decision-record README, the
  insight files, and file counts (components, specs, stories, visual
  baselines, tokens). Drives the Harness page, and the counts on Home.

The harness generator fails loudly rather than writing a confident zero: if a
parse finds no lint rules, no baselines or no decision rows, it exits non-zero.

Source checkout: `~/Projects/scorp-ds` (override with `SCORP_DS_DIR`). The
snapshot commit is recorded in `vendor/scorp-ds/VERSION`.
