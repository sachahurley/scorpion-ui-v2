 * 1px box, clipped, still rendered), never `display: none` or
 * `visibility: hidden`, which would take the text out of the accessibility
 * tree along with the pixels. If the text should be hidden from everyone, use
 * `aria-hidden` or do not render it.
 *
 * Forwards its ref to the underlying element and spreads native attributes
 * (`id`, `htmlFor` via `label`, `data-*`), so the hidden text can be
 * referenced by `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`.
