The quality of your input—whether design tokens in Figma or a code-based design system—directly determines the quality and accuracy of AI-generated outputs. Pixel-perfect products require systematic, high-quality foundations that AI agents can reliably draw from.",

Use an HTML-to-Figma plugin to pull these components into Figma. In Figma, refine the visual expression and tokenize elements (e.g., color swatches for amber 100-950). Use Figma MCP to create a link to your refined design. Paste the link in Cursor and instruct the agent to replace the initial documentation with pixel-perfect implementation from your Figma design.',

Document the complete token structure: base colors and semantic colors; typography scales and weights; spacing and radius values; component-specific tokens (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.). Create a comprehensive markdown file listing every token name and its value. This is your learning tool—you're adopting the company's existing naming conventions.",

In Figma, refine the visual presentation (but keep the token names consistent with code). Create color swatches, type specimens, component examples—all labeled with the existing token names. Use Figma MCP to create links to your refined documentation design. Feed these back to Cursor to update the documentation pixel-perfectly.",

Perform code reviews: map your work against the markdown file to ensure you're using company conventions correctly.",

        text: "Start with foundational tokens (colors, typography, spacing). Move to component tokens (buttons, inputs, cards). Then document complex interactions (hover states, focus states, disabled states). Each documentation page you build teaches you more about the system's logic and naming patterns. The documentation you create becomes the visual reference designers have been missing.",

This enables precise communication: "Change the button to use color-primary-600 instead of color-primary-500". As you document more components, you build fluency in the company\'s design language.
