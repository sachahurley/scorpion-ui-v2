/**
 * HARNESS PAGE
 *
 * The verification story: everything in scorp-ds that can fail. Lint rules,
 * CI workflows, the token drift test, the accessibility pass, the visual
 * baselines, the API-surface contract, and the written records behind them.
 *
 * Authored as a typed CaseStudyBlock array, the same editorial layout as the
 * Essay, Case Study and Skills pages, with two additions the other pages
 * don't use:
 *
 * - `ascii` blocks for the diagrams. Preformatted box-drawing text rather
 *   than images, so they stay selectable, retint with the theme, and never
 *   need a second asset for dark mode. Every glyph is from Box Drawing
 *   (U+2500-257F), which the DS ships a face for and audits in CI.
 * - `slot` blocks for live specimens: a LogView showing what a failed gate
 *   actually prints, a StatusLine summarising a run, and the generated
 *   tables of rules, workflows and decisions.
 *
 * Every number and list on this page is READ FROM src/data/harness-index.json,
 * never typed here. vendor:ds regenerates it from the scorp-ds repo via
 * scripts/gen-harness-index.mjs and ds:check flags drift, so a page about a
 * system that refuses to report what it did not check cannot itself quote a
 * count the repo no longer has.
