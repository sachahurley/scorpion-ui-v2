/**
 * SKILLS PAGE
 *
 * The agent-operations story: the named, repeatable workflows (Claude Code
 * skills) that build and maintain Scorp DS. Authored as a typed
 * CaseStudyBlock array and rendered by CaseStudyBlocks, the same editorial
 * layout as the Essay and Case Study pages: headline blocks for the title
 * and sections, list blocks for the skills themselves.
 *
 * The list is a curated snapshot of the repo's skill index (Figma-pipeline
 * skills are deliberately omitted here). Source of truth:
